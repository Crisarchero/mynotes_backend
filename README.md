# MyNotes(backend)
MyNotes is a digital notebook web application. It uses MongoDB, Node with Express, and React with React Router. It’s a proof of concept more than anything, so it isn’t recommended for practical uses in its current state. This is the back end.

##CRUD operations

The backend uses HTTP requests to add to the database, return data from the database, update data and delete data.  However, it will only receive HTTP requests from users with a JavaScript Web Token.
